# React Design Patterns – Practice Repository (Typescript)

This repository contains my hands-on practice of **React design patterns**.

The goal of this repository is to understand design patterns by **building them**, not just reading about them.  
Each pattern is implemented in a clean and simple way so others can easily refer to it and take inspiration.

---

## Why this repository exists

Many developers know design patterns by name but struggle to apply them correctly in real projects.

This repository is created to:
- Practice React design patterns with real code
- Understand when and why a pattern should be used
- Keep code readable and maintainable
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions and over-engineering

This is not a tutorial repository.  
This is a **learning-in-public and reference repository**.

---

## Repository structure

- Each design pattern lives in its own folder
- Each pattern focuses on:
  - Clear responsibilities
  - Simple and readable code
  - Practical, real-world use cases
- No unnecessary complexity
- Patterns are added only after proper hands-on practice

---

## Current progress

- **Container–Presenter Pattern (Smart–Dumb Components)**  
  Separates business logic from UI rendering to keep components clean and easy to maintain.

---

## Future updates

This repository will be continuously updated as I practice more React patterns, such as:
- Compound Components
- Custom Hooks patterns
- Render Props
- State colocation
- Controlled vs uncontrolled components
- Feature-based architecture
- Other real-world React patterns

Patterns will be added gradually, based on understanding and real usage.

---

## Final note

This repository is meant to grow slowly and intentionally.

The focus is not on quantity, but on:
- Clarity
- Maintainability
- Real-world understanding
- Writing code that can be easily understood by others

Anyone is free to refer to this repository and take inspiration from it.
