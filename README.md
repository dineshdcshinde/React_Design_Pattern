React Design Patterns – Practice Repository

This repository contains my hands-on practice of React design patterns.

The goal of this repo is simple:

To understand design patterns by actually building them

To keep examples clean, readable, and maintainable

To help others learn from real code, not theory

Each pattern is implemented in isolation so it can be easily understood and reused.

Why this repository exists

Most developers know design patterns by name, but struggle to apply them correctly.

This repository is created to:

Practice patterns with real components

Understand when and why a pattern is used

Avoid over-engineering

Build a long-term, maintainable mindset as a frontend developer

This is not a tutorial repo.
This is a learning-in-public and reference repo.

How this repository is structured

Each design pattern lives in its own folder

Every pattern focuses on:

Clear responsibility

Simple code

Practical use cases

Minimal abstractions

No unnecessary complexity

Current progress

Container–Presenter (Smart–Dumb Components)

This pattern focuses on separating business logic from UI rendering to keep components clean and readable.

Future updates

This repository will be continuously updated as I practice more patterns, such as:

Compound Components

Custom Hooks patterns

Render Props

State Colocation

Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

Feature-based architecture

Other real-world React patterns

Each pattern will be added only after proper hands-on practice.

Final note

This repo is meant to grow slowly and intentionally.

The focus is not on quantity, but on:

Understanding

Clarity

Maintainability

Real-world usage

Anyone is free to refer to this repo and take inspiration from it.
